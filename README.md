# traffic-lights

My project is a traffic light for both cars and pedestrians 
with time delay and audible warning during the green color of pedestrians
this project we needed:

-a development plate Funduino Uno(copy of the Arduino development plate
Uno);

-3 leds (red, yellow, green) representing the traffic light for cars;

-2 leds (red, green) what is the traffic light for pedestrians

-A seven segment display device that represents timing
traffic lights on the red traffic light for those cars
green of pedestrian traffic light

-A buzzer that will emit audible signals
for the pedestrian traffic at the time segment type 7 display arrives
to number “5”

-5 resistant to the 1kΩ value used for LEDs

-7 resistant to 220Ω value used to connect the display pins of
Segment seven Type
